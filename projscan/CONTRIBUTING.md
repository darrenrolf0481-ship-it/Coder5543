### Adding a language

As of 0.10, projscan has a `LanguageAdapter` interface (`src/core/languages/LanguageAdapter.ts`). Adding a new language means:

1. Implement the interface in `src/core/languages/<lang>Adapter.ts`. The Python adapter (`pythonAdapter.ts`) is the reference - it wraps a tree-sitter grammar, extracts imports/exports/symbol defs, resolves imports, and detects package roots.
2. Register the adapter in `src/core/languages/registry.ts`.
3. If the parser needs a grammar binary (e.g. another tree-sitter language), vendor the wasm under `dist/grammars/` via `scripts/copy-wasm.mjs` and add a test in `tests/integration/packSmokeTest.test.ts` that asserts it ships in the tarball.
4. Add language-specific analyzers under `src/analyzers/<lang>*.ts` (see `pythonTestCheck.ts`, `pythonLinterCheck.ts` for the pattern) and wire them into `src/core/issueEngine.ts`.
5. Add tests mirroring `tests/core/languages/pythonAdapter.*.test.ts` coverage (parse, imports, exports, resolver, package roots).

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier for formatting
- Keep dependencies minimal - avoid adding new runtime dependencies unless necessary
- Write tests for new analyzers and fixers

## Stable surface

The MCP tool inventory, CLI command list, and exit codes documented in `docs/STABILITY.md` are the **public contract**. CI runs `npm run check:stability` which compares the current build against `stability-baseline.json` checked into the repo root.

- **Adding** a new MCP tool, optional argument, or CLI command is fine - the guard prints additions but does not fail.
- **Removing** or **renaming** anything in the stable surface fails the guard. Either restore the surface or, if the change is intentional and warrants a major version bump, regenerate the baseline:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  node scripts/check-stability.mjs --update
  ```

  Only run `--update` when you genuinely intend to break the contract (i.e. a major-version release). The friction is the point.

## Areas wanting help

Concrete on-ramps for new contributors. Each is scoped to fit a first PR. Pre-drafted starter tasks live under [`.github/seed-issues/`](.github/seed-issues/) — pick one and either claim its corresponding GitHub issue or open one and link the file.

- **New language adapters.** The `LanguageAdapter` interface (`src/core/languages/LanguageAdapter.ts`) is the cleanest entry point. Seven languages are wired today (JS, TS, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust). The Python and Rust adapters are good references — Python for the simplest shape, Rust for a recent end-to-end example. Each adapter is ~200 LOC plus walkers (imports, exports, CC, per-fn CC, callSites) and a vendored tree-sitter grammar wasm. Pre-drafted tickets: [PHP](.github/seed-issues/02-add-php-language-adapter.md), [C#](.github/seed-issues/03-add-c-sharp-language-adapter.md). Plus a [step-by-step walkthrough doc](.github/seed-issues/08-doc-walkthrough-language-adapter.md) is itself an open issue.
- **New analyzers.** Issue checkers live in `src/analyzers/`. Each is a pure function `(rootPath, files) => Promise<Issue[]>`. Existing ones (`testCheck`, `prettierCheck`, `securityCheck`, `dependencyRiskCheck`, `cycleCheck`) are good shape templates. Wire into `src/core/issueEngine.ts`. Tests in `tests/analyzers/`.
- **New reporters.** Output formatters in `src/reporters/`. Implement the same surface as `consoleReporter.ts` / `markdownReporter.ts` / `jsonReporter.ts` / `htmlReporter.ts`. Pre-drafted tickets: [HTML for `pr-diff`](.github/seed-issues/04-html-reporter-for-pr-diff.md), [HTML for `coverage`](.github/seed-issues/05-html-reporter-for-coverage.md).
- **MCP tools.** Each tool is a `{name, description, inputSchema, handler}` object exported from `src/mcp/tools/<name>.ts` and registered in `src/mcp/tools.ts`. Mirror an existing one (e.g. `src/mcp/tools/coupling.ts` is a clean shape). Add a `tools/list` assertion to `tests/mcp/server.test.ts`.
- **Fix-suggest templates.** The rule-driven action-prompt registry in `src/core/fixSuggest.ts` covers ~12 issue families. Each new template is ~25 LOC. Pre-drafted ticket: [eslint-\* template](.github/seed-issues/06-eslint-fix-suggest-template.md).
- **UX polish.** Small, high-leverage CLI ergonomics. Pre-drafted ticket: [impact-symbol disambiguation warning](.github/seed-issues/07-impact-cli-symbol-disambiguation.md).
- **Documentation.** `docs/GUIDE.md` covers the agent journey + per-command reference; tighter sections still wanted: per-analyzer "what triggers / how to silence" tables, monorepo setup walkthroughs, framework-specific guides.

### First-time contributor walkthrough

If you've never landed a PR on this repo before, the smallest possible loop:

```sh
# 1. Fork on GitHub, then locally:
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/projscan.git
cd projscan

# 2. Verify the baseline works (no code changes yet)
npm install
npm test                              # 800+ tests, ~6s
npm run lint                          # eslint, no errors expected
npm run build                         # tsc + wasm copy + manifest generation
npm run check:stability               # baseline diff; should be clean

# 3. Pick a seed issue, mirror the template it points at
#    e.g. .github/seed-issues/06-eslint-fix-suggest-template.md
#    -> open src/core/fixSuggest.ts, find the existing templates,
#       mirror one, write tests, run npm test

# 4. Commit + push to your fork
git checkout -b feat/eslint-fix-template
git add -A
git commit -m "Add fix-suggest template for eslint-* rules"
git push origin feat/eslint-fix-template

# 5. Open a PR back to abhiyoheswaran1/projscan:main
#    Reference the seed issue file in the PR description.
```

CI runs the same checks (`npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check:stability`) on every PR. As long as those pass, a maintainer will review.

For larger work (refactors, cross-cutting changes), open an issue first to discuss the approach. We'd rather agree on the shape before you spend a weekend on it.

## Releasing

A release is a seven-step ritual. Skipping any step leaves something out of sync.

1. **Bump version** in `package.json` (semver: patch for fixes, minor for features, major if anything breaks).
2. **Write the CHANGELOG entry** at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` using the existing Keep-a-Changelog format. Cover Added / Changed / Removed / Notes. Be honest about tradeoffs.
3. **Verify the build artifact** locally: `npm run build && npm run test`. The build runs `tsc + copy-wasm + generate-tool-manifest`; all three must succeed. Tests must be green.
4. **Tag and publish.** Merge to `main`, then `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z && npm publish`.
5. **Create the GitHub Release** at the new tag and **attach `dist/tool-manifest.json`** as a release asset (`gh release create vX.Y.Z dist/tool-manifest.json --title ... --notes ...`). The website's docs page reads this asset.
6. **Republish to the MCP Registry.** Edit `.github/mcp-registry/server.json` and bump both `version` fields (top-level and `packages[0].version`) to the new version. Then run `/tmp/mcp-publisher publish .github/mcp-registry/server.json` (or wherever the publisher binary lives — see `.github/mcp-registry/SUBMIT.md`). The registry stores all published versions; not republishing means the registry's "latest" pointer drifts behind npm. Validation should pass before any publish: `mcp-publisher validate .github/mcp-registry/server.json`.
7. **Bump the website's expectations.** In the personal-website repo, open `tools.astro` (or wherever the EXPECTED block lives) and edit:
   - The hardcoded **manifest URL pin** → swap `releases/download/vX.Y.Z/tool-manifest.json` for the new tag
   - `EXPECTED.minVersion` → the new version
   - `EXPECTED.requiredTools` → append any new MCP tool names the release added

   The website build refuses to run until all three edits are in. That friction is the feature - it prevents the docs page from drifting out of sync with the published tool surface.

   The changelog page does NOT need a manual bump - it pulls `CHANGELOG.md` from `main` at build time, so the next site build after the release naturally picks up the new entry.

The MCP-tool count, runtime-dep count, and any "X tools" / "Y languages" claims in `README.md` and `docs/` are hand-edited; sweep for them when the release adds tools or languages.
