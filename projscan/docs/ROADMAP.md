# ProjScan Roadmap

Last reviewed 2026-05-05.

## Vision

**The shared code-intelligence substrate that AI coding agents stand on.**

Every agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Continue, custom orchestrations — needs the same things from the codebase it's editing: structural awareness, change-impact analysis, health signals, fix guidance. None of them want to build that themselves. projscan is the open, offline, agent-native MCP server that gives every agent the same accurate view, so they can spend their context and inference budget on the actual reasoning, not on grepping the repo.

## Stable since 1.0

projscan 1.0 shipped 2026-05-04. The stability contract is in force: MCP tool names and input schemas, CLI command names and documented flags, exit codes, and JSON output keys are under semver protection. Breaking any of them requires a 2.0 with a deprecation cycle.

## Strategic context

Three forces define the next 12 months for projscan:

1. **MCP is the de-facto standard.** The ecosystem has 10,000+ public servers; Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Windsurf, and Codex all consume MCP. The protocol war is over; the value migrates to the _quality_ of individual servers. Code-intelligence is one of the highest-value categories.
2. **Multi-agent orchestration is the dominant 2026 pattern.** Claude Agent Teams, swarms, sub-agents. The new pain point is _coordination_: agents have separate context windows and need a shared source-of-truth about the codebase. projscan's graph + cache + budget-aware tools are uniquely positioned to be that shared substrate.
3. **Context-window cost compounds.** Token spend per turn is no longer the bottleneck — it's the _accumulated_ cost of carrying tool results, AST excerpts, and prior turns through every inference call. Agents that retrieve narrowly and budget aggressively win. projscan's `max_tokens`-aware response shaping, cursor pagination, and per-function chunking are exactly the primitives this trend rewards.

## The competitive picture

| Tool                       | Position                                 | What they do well                                                         | What we beat them on                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Pathfinder**        | Direct competitor (MCP code-intel)       | Deep static analysis: AST + CFG + DFG, dataflow tracking, security focus. | Language coverage (9 vs 1: Python). Composed agent tools (review / fix-suggest / impact / watch). Health signals (churn × CC, hotspots). Monorepo workspace awareness. |
| **Sourcegraph Cody / Amp** | Enterprise paid tier                     | Cross-repo indexing at org scale. Polished editor integrations.           | Fully offline. Open source. No SaaS dependency. Free for everyone.                                                                                                     |
| **Continue.dev**           | Configurable RAG + MCP client            | Highly extensible context providers. Local-first.                         | We're a _server_, not a client; we feed Continue (and every other MCP client). Different category.                                                                     |
| **Aider**                  | Terminal-native pair programmer          | Tight Git integration, conversational refactor flow.                      | Different category — we're not a coding agent; we're what coding agents stand on.                                                                                      |
| **GitHub MCP server**      | Adjacent (repo metadata, not code intel) | Issues / PRs / Actions surface.                                           | We do code structure; they do collaboration metadata. Complementary, not competing.                                                                                    |

**Where we're vulnerable:** Code Pathfinder has deeper analysis (CFG, DFG) and a security-finding focus. If they ship a JavaScript or TypeScript adapter, our breadth lead narrows.

**Where we lead:** breadth (9 languages), agent-native composition (one-call review, fix-suggest, impact), monorepo support, the 1.0 stability contract, and a cleaner agent-journey product story (diagnose → review → fix → reach → live).

## Strategy

Four plays, in order:

1. **Defend the lead** — close the obvious gaps so users picking an MCP server for code intel have one less reason to go elsewhere. ✅ Largely complete (1.1–1.3).
2. **Lean into multi-agent** — make projscan the _shared substrate_ for agent swarms. This is where the market is moving and where our context-budget design pays off. ✅ Largely shipped (1.4 Session, 1.5 Budgeted by default + Project Memory).
3. **Become the operator, not the advisor** — stop suggesting and start acting (cross-repo, apply, security gate). **Now (1.6).**
4. **Expand the moat** — depth where it matters (CFG / dataflow on hot paths, more languages, sub-file embeddings, cost analytics, live PR review). Not everywhere; we're not trying to be Cody. **Next (1.7 → 1.10), then 2.0.**

We are _not_ trying to be:

- A coding agent (we're what agents call into).
- A SaaS / dashboard product.
- A general-purpose static analyzer competing with SonarQube / Semgrep / Snyk.
- A linting / formatting tool.

## Now / Next / Later

### Now — 1.7 → 1.10 (Q4 2026 — 2027)

**Theme arc: "From advisor to operator."** 1.6 (Operator) just shipped — projscan now acts across boundaries (cross-repo), inside the codebase (apply layer), and at the security gate (taint flow). Next: breadth (mobile, C++), depth (cost analytics, live review), and the platform commitment (2.0 plugin API).

| Release                     | Theme                                                                                       | Why an agent must have this                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.7.0 "Mobile"**          | Kotlin and Swift adapters                                                                   | Two huge codebases projscan can't see today: Android and iOS. Closing the mobile gap before competitors do.                                                                                          |
| **1.8.0 "Depth"**           | C++ adapter + Project Memory loop #3 (per-rule confidence) + sub-file embedding refinements | C++ for systems / games / embedded. Per-rule confidence weighting auto-deprioritizes rules with low fix-rates — Project Memory's third loop, viable now that ~6 months of accumulated signal exists. |
| **1.9.0 "Cost Visibility"** | Aggregate cost analytics, per-tool cost catalog                                             | Agents can't optimize tokens they can't see. The `_cost` sidecar (1.5) was per-call; 1.9 is the dashboard view: session totals, top spenders, pre-call cost budgets.                                 |
| **1.10.0 "Live Reviewer"**  | Long-running PR-watch mode                                                                  | `projscan_review` is a snapshot. PRs are streams. Subscribe-once-watch-forever closes the long-session loop on PRs the way `--watch` (1.3) did for files. The capstone for the agent-substrate arc.  |

### Later — 2.0 (2027+)

**2.0.0 "Plugin API + Breaking"** — after 1.10 the agent-substrate arc is mature. Time to commit a platform contract.

- **Plugin API.** Third parties write `.projscan-plugin.json` declaring an analyzer or reporter; projscan dispatches via a stable interface. `projscan plugin list` for discovery. Turns projscan from a tool into a substrate other tools build on.
- Remove deprecated regex extractors (`extractImports` / `extractExports`, marked `@deprecated` in 0.17).
- JSON output schema cleanups — consolidate the optional-field accumulation that grew through 0.x → 1.x.
- `LanguageId` becomes plugin-extensible (no longer a closed type).
- 1.x compatibility shim for 6 months with stderr deprecation warnings.
- HTML report theming: white-label via plugin API rather than core feature.

## Non-goals

- **Coding agent.** We don't write code; we tell agents what's there.
- **SaaS / dashboard.** projscan is a local tool; cloud features are off the table for the 1.x line.
- **Snyk / SonarQube competition.** SAST stays minimal; if we add CFG/DFG it's narrowly targeted at agent use cases (taint tracking inside a review), not general security scanning.
- **IDE-specific extensions.** projscan is an MCP server. The CLI is for humans. No VS Code extension, no JetBrains plugin.
- **LLM-inside-projscan.** `projscan_fix_suggest` is rule-driven by design. The driving agent is the LLM; we feed it structured prompts. We will not embed an inference call.

## Risks

- **Code Pathfinder catches up on languages.** They're 1-language today (Python) but the AST + CFG infrastructure is solid. If they ship a JS/TS adapter, our breadth lead narrows. Mitigation: keep adding languages on the cadence; deepen agent-native composition.
- **Multi-agent orchestration matures faster than we can ship Session.** If Claude Agent Teams becomes the default and ships its own shared-state primitive, our 1.4 bet weakens. Mitigation: design Session as a _complement_ to Agent Teams rather than a replacement.
- **Context-cost trend reverses.** If models get cheaper and context windows grow, our budget-aware design becomes table stakes rather than a differentiator. Mitigation: that's a good problem to have; the underlying primitives still work.

## How to influence this roadmap

If you've adopted projscan and want something specific:

- **Open a GitHub issue** describing the use case. The "what an agent of mine couldn't answer" framing helps prioritize over generic feature requests.
- **For larger work** (a new MCP tool category, a refactor, a 2.0 candidate), open a discussion first so we can align on the shape before you spend a weekend on it.
